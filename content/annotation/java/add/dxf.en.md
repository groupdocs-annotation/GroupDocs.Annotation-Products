    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API"
    content: |
        GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API is a library that allows you to add annotations to PDF, Word and other documents on Mac, Windows or Ubuntu. [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java](/annotation/java) is a native Java API for managing annotations with comprehensive support for creating, adding, editing, deleting, extracting and exporting annotations from images and various other documents. The full list of supported document formats you could see on this [page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/supported-document-formats/).

        This library allows you to work not only with DXF document but also with many other types documents such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook emails, Visio, Adobe, OpenDocument, OpenOffice, Photoshop, AutoCad and many others.

          title: "About DXF File Format"
          content: |
            DXF, Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format, is a tagged data representation of AutoCAD drawing file. Each element in the file has a prefix integer number called a group code. This group code actually represents the element that follows and indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object type. DXF makes it possible to represent almost all user-specified information in a drawing file. DXF file format was developed by Autodesk as CAD data file format for data interoperability between AutoCAD and other applications. Thus, data can be imported from other formats to DXF to AutoCAD as per the DXF file format interoperability specifications.
