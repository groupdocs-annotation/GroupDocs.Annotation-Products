    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java](/annotation/java/) is a native Java annotations manipulation solution to efficiently view, add, update, delete and extract annotations from images and document file formats. Users can easily edit comments, notes, remarks and various annotation types including text, graphics and watermark in PDF, HTML, Word, Excel, Visio diagrams, presentations, drawings, images, and many other file formats. The annotation-processing feature can precisely read the annotations from imported documents and allows exporting back into the original or desired file format after implementing the customization.

    title_left: "Steps to Edit Annotations from JPEG in Java"
    content_left: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation](/annotation/java/) makes it easier for Java developers to update various annotation properties from JPEG files within any Java-based application by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Instantiate Annotator object with input document path or stream with instantiated LoadOptions with ImportAnnotations = true.
        *   Create some AnnotationBase implementation and set Id of existed annotation (if annotation with that Id not found, nothing will be changed) or path list of annotations (all existed annotations will be removed).
        *   Call update method of Annotator object with passed annotations.
        *   Call save method with resultant document path or stream and SaveOptions object.

          title: "About JPEG File Format"
          content: |
            A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
