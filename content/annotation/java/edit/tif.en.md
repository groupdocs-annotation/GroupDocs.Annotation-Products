    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API"
    content: |
        GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API is a library that allows you to add annotations to PDF, Word and other documents on Mac, Windows or Ubuntu. [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java](/annotation/java]) is a native Java API for managing annotations with comprehensive support for creating, adding, editing, deleting, extracting and exporting annotations from images and various other documents. The full list of supported document formats you could see on this [page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/supported-document-formats/).

        This library allows you to work not only with TIF document but also with many other types documents such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook emails, Visio, Adobe, OpenDocument, OpenOffice, Photoshop, AutoCad and many others.

        The GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API allows you to create and [add](/annotation/java/add/tif/) new notes, edit annotations, [extract](/annotation/java/extract/tif/) comments, annotations, and [remove](/annotation/java/remove/tif/) them from documents. The library supports 13 different annotation types, including Text, Polyline, Area, Underline, Point, Watermark, Arrow, Ellipse, Text Replacement, Distance, Text Field, Resource Redaction in PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word documents, spreadsheets, diagrams, presentations, drawings, images and many other file formats.

        The example (please see below) demonstrates working with TIF document, in this example you could see the main steps of how to work with GroupDocs.Annotation: Setup a license, open a document you want to work with, creating an annotation, adding data objects to set annotation properties according to your requirements and saving the result to the needed place. Also you could have a look more detailed on the supported features on our github [page](https://github.com/groupdocs-annotation/GroupDocs.Annotation-for-Java), or in our product [documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/annotation/java/getting-started/).

    title_left: "Steps to Edit Annotations in TIF in Java"
    content_left: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation](/annotation/java/) makes it easier for Java developers to update various annotation properties from TIF files within any Java-based application by implementing a few easy steps.
        
        *   Instantiate Annotator object with input document path or stream with instantiated LoadOptions with ImportAnnotations = true.
        *   Create some AnnotationBase implementation and set Id of existed annotation (if annotation with that Id not found, nothing will be changed) or path list of annotations (all existed annotations will be removed).
        *   Call update method of Annotator object with passed annotations.
        *   Call save method with resultant document path or stream and SaveOptions object.
    
    title_right: "System Requirements"
    content_right: |
        GroupDocs.Annotation for Java APIs are supported on all major platforms and operating systems. Before executing the code below, please make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system.
        
        *   Operating Systems: Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS

          content: |
            TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems.
