        [GroupDocs.Annotation](/annotation/net/) makes it easy for .NET developers to edit annotation details from ODT files within their applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Instantiate Annotator object with input document path or stream.
        *   Create some AnnotationBase implementation and set Id of existed annotation (if annotation with that Id not found, nothing will be changed) or path list of annotations (all existed annotations will be removed).
        *   Call Update method of Annotator object with passed annotations.
        *   Call Save method with resultant document path or stream and SaveOptions object.

            ODT files are type of documents created with word processing applications that are based on OpenDocument Text File format. These are created with word processor applications such as free OpenOffice Writer and can hold content such as text, images, objects and styles. The ODT file is to Writer word processor what the DOCX is to Microsoft Word. Several applications including Google Docs and Google's web-based word processor included with Google Drive can open the ODT files for editing. Microsoft Word can also open ODT files and save it in to other formats such as DOC and DOCX.
