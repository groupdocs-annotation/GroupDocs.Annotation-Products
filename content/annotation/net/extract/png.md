    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET](/annotation/net/) is a native .NET annotation management API to read, [add](/annotation/net/add/bmp/), [edit](/annotation/net/edit/bmp/), [remove](/annotation/net/remove/bmp/), extract and export annotations from images and document file formats. Users can easily extract comments, notes, remarks and various annotation types including text, graphics and watermarks from PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Visio diagrams, PowerPoint presentations, drawings, images, and many other file formats. The annotation-processing feature can accurately read the annotations from the imported documents and allows exporting back into the original or desired file format after implementing the annotations customization.

            PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
