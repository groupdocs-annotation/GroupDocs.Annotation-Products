[GroupDocs.Annotation for Net](/annotation/net]) is a native Net API for managing annotations with comprehensive support for creating, adding, editing, deleting, extracting and exporting annotations from images and various other documents. The full list of supported document formats you could see on this [page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/annotation/net/supported-document-formats/).

        This library allows you to work not only with PPSX document but also with many other types documents such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook emails, Visio, Adobe, OpenDocument, OpenOffice, Photoshop, AutoCad and many others.
