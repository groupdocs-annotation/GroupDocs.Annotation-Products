    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET](/annotation/net/) is a native .NET annotation management API to read, add, edit, remove, extract and export annotations from images and document file formats. Users can easily extract comments, notes, remarks and various annotation types including text, graphics and watermarks from PDF, HTML, Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Visio diagrams, PowerPoint presentations, drawings, images, and many other file formats. The annotation-processing feature can accurately read the annotations from the imported documents and allows exporting back into the original or desired file format after implementing the annotations customization.

        [GroupDocs.Annotation](/annotation/net/) makes it easier for .NET developers to extract annotation information from XLSB files within their applications by implementing a few easy steps.

        *   Instantiate Annotator object with input document path or stream.
        *   Instantiate LoadOptions object and set ImportAnnotation = true.
        *   Define variable with type List.
        *   Call Get method and return result to variable above.
        *   Instantiate XmlSerializer object with type List.
        *   Using FileStreamobject, serialize annotations to the file as on example below.

        using (Annotator annotator = new Annotator("annotated.xlsb"))
        {
        	List annotations = annotator.Get();
        	XmlSerializer formatter = new XmlSerializer(typeof(List));
        	using (FileStream fs = new FileStream("annotations.xml", FileMode.Create))
            {
            	fs.SetLength(0);
                formatter.Serialize(fs, annotations);

          title: "About XLSB File Format"
          content: |
            XLSB file format specifies the Excel Binary File Format, which is a collection of records and structures that specify Excel workbook content. The content can include unstructured or semi-structured tables of numbers, text, or both numbers and text, formulas, external data connections, charts and images. Unlike XLSX (which is based on Open XML file format), the XLSB represents binary Excel workbook file. XLSB files can be read and written to faster which makes them useful for working with large files. XLSB is seldom used to store workbooks as XLSX (and previously XLS) are the most common user selected file formats for saving workbooks. It can be opened by Microsoft Office 2007 and above.
