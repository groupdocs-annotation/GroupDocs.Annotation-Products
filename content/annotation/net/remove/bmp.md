    title: "About GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET API"
    content: |
        [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/annotation/net) is a native .NET annotation processing API to view, add, modify, remove and extract annotations from images and document file formats. Users can easily delete comments, notes, remarks and various annotation types including text, graphics and watermarks in PDF, HTML, Word, Excel, Visio diagrams, presentations, drawings, images, and many other file formats. The annotation-processing feature can precisely read the annotations from imported documents and allows exporting back into the original or desired file format after implementing the customization.

          content: |
            Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
