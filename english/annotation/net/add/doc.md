        [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/annotation/net) is a native .NET API that enables users to add, edit and remove annotations from images and document file formats. You can easily employ comments, notes, remarks and various annotation types including text, graphics and watermark to PDF, HTML, Word, Excel, Visio diagrams, presentations, drawings, images, and many other file formats.

          content: |
            Files with .doc extension represent documents generated by Microsoft Word or other word processing documents in binary file format. The extension was initially used for plain text documentation on several different operating systems. It can contain several different types of data such as images, formatted as well as plain text, graphs, charts, embedded objects, links, pages, page formatting, print settings and a lot others. The format was popular for all sorts of documentation due to the variety of options it offers to users for writing manuals, proposals, specifications, resumes, articles or any similar documents. The updated version of DOC is DOCX which is based on Office OpenXML whose specifications are openly available.
